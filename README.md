# QA3.2
# Quarterly-Assessment-3

This project is part of the Quarterly Assessment for the DS 3850 course. It is a Python-based quiz application using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The application allows users to select a quiz category and answer multiple-choice questions from a database. The user's score is calculated based on their responses, and they receive feedback at the end of the quiz.
